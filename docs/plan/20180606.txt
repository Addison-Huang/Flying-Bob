HW 58 -- Keep the Pointy End Pointing Upward
2018 06 06

Which jobs are most crucial?
- Allow students to pick classes to waitlist themselves to 
- Allow generation of schedules
- Allow administrators to seed data for the purpose of demonstration
- Integrate CSVs to store data so that it reamains after program ends 

Which components constitute core functionality?
- Essential: Coding our Student and Admin class to extend the User class(Completed)
- Essential: adding a login function(Completed)
- Essential: Writing the course class and allowing a student to choose courses(Will be completed on 6/6) 
- Essential: Generating schedules using recursive backtracking(Will be completed on 6/6) 

Which components are prerequisites for others?
-We need to write the abstract use class before the student and admin class.
-Also, a course class needs to be written before a student can choose courses.
-Lastly, programming a student's schedule will be completed after all the other classes are written

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
- We must tackle the generation of schedules and the functionality of students picking classes that they want to waitlist themselves to -- this is a complicated part of our core functionality that we will tackle on 6/6 via an online skype call. 
- Implementation of CSVs can be delegated
- Allow seeding of data by administrator for purpose of simulation can be delegated

What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?
- Finish up flow of driver class allowing generation of schedules and allowing students to choose courses(Will be completed on 6/6 via a skype call at night)
- Allow seeding of data for purpose of simulation(Will be completed on 6/7)
- Add non-essential functionality(improve UI), finish testing(Will be completed on 6/7)
To accomodate for setbacks: We will individually work on everything past the core functionality on 6/7, however, if we can't finish the generation of schedules and the waitlist procedure, we will work on it together via an online skype call on 6/7 as well.
